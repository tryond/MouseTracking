# Mouse Visualizer

Mouse Visualizer is a desktop application which captures and displays a user's mouse strokes.

## Description

Mouse Visualizer continously monitors the cursor location and displays the stroke on-screen once it has been completed. The display also includes the duration of the stroke from start to finish.

## Motivation

Mouse Visualization has been developed alongside a suite of human-computer interaction research modules funded by Ore Technical Labs. 

## Instructions

### Download

Download 'mouse-visualizer.jar' release found [here](https://github.com/tryond/mouse-visualizer/releases).

### Usage

After downloading, open the .jar file and the application window will appear. The application will monitor your mouse behavior and display a mouse stroke whenever one is created.
